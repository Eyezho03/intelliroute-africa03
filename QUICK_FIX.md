# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix for MapContainer Error

## The Issue
The `render2 is not a function` error is caused by cached Leaflet modules in `node_modules`. Even though we removed the imports, the cached dependencies are still causing conflicts.

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Clear Cache and Reinstall
```bash
# Navigate to Frontend directory
cd Frontend

# Remove cached modules and lock file
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf .vite

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Alternative Quick Fix (If above doesn't work)
```bash
# Force clear all caches
npm cache clean --force

# Remove Vite cache
npx vite --clearCache

# Reinstall and restart
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify Fix
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Login as driver: `driver@intelliroute.com` / `driver123`
3. Check that dashboard loads without MapContainer errors

## What We Fixed
- âœ… Removed all Leaflet imports from DriverDashboard.jsx
- âœ… Removed `leaflet` and `react-leaflet` from package.json
- âœ… Replaced MapContainer with static location display
- âœ… Cleaned up all Leaflet icon configuration code

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. Leaflet dependencies were cached in `node_modules`
2. Vite was serving cached modules with MapContainer references
3. React was trying to render a non-existent component

## Prevention
- Always clear cache when removing major dependencies
- Use `npm ls` to verify dependencies are completely removed
- Test in incognito/private browser window to avoid browser cache

**After running the commands above, your driver dashboard will load without any MapContainer errors! ðŸŽ¯**
